# The_Black_Hack_2e_Booklet_MD_1.0
A Markdown version of The Black Hack 2nd Edition "Black Booklet" role-playing game plalyer's supplement by David Black / published by SquareHex.

## What's Included
All the essential rules you need (excluding monsters) to play The Black Hack Second Edition in ~~a 26 page booklet~~ markdown format. If you're a player then this is all you need to play. If you're a GM then this will give you faster access to the most common rules you need during a game. (Description borrowed from OBS listing)

## Why Did I Do It?
I stripped the player booklet down to Markdown format for use as Helper content at the [Role Gate](https://www.rolegate.com/ref/wispsoftime) text-based play-by-post online service. You can find the public Helper there based on this file.
